# Q-Programming-Language
The Q Programming Language is a powerful and easy to read programming language with features from Assembly and C. Although it is designed to be used specifically for programming the Q Operating System, it can be used for general purpose lowish-level programming projects that would origionally have been done in Assembly/C/C++.

Q is an Object Oriented Programming Language with one key feature that no other languages have - Assembly Level CPU Access with ActionScript like syntax. What this means, in simpler terms, is you are able to change individual registers such as <code>eax</code> or <code>al</code> like you would in assembly, but in a language that also supports <code>if statments</code>, <code>while loops</code>, <code>functions</code> and many other features edvident in high-level languages such as Java and C.
